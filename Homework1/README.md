### Examples of GOOD UI:
- Spotify

    - Purpose of interface:
        - Discover new music.
    - Aspect I find good:
        - The left, middle, and right panes each perform a consistent, distinct purpose.
    - Justification:
        - The left pane allows users to navigate music they have already saved or added to their playlists. The middle pane allows users to explore new or current artists. The right pane displays what friends are listening to. These different functions are kept consistenly in the same position making the user experience easily intuitive.
- TeamSpeak

    - Purpose of interface:
        - Allow users to connect to voice chat servers.
    - Aspect I find good:
        - This application's interface performs a singular purpose and does it well.
    - Justification:
         - Unlike most voice chat application interfaces (Discord, Skype, Zoom), TeamSpeak is very light and minimal. The interface is designed to connect and disconnect from voice channels and is not concerned with much else.

### Examples of BAD UI:
- Netflix App for Amazon Fire TV

    - Purpose of interface:
        - Allow users to browse movies/TV shows.
    - Aspect I find bad:
        - When scrolling through options the app will autoplay snippets of the currently selected content.
    - Justification:
        - The user is bombarded with audio/video specifically chosen to be attention-grabbing. The interface was designed this way so that users will have a constant stream of movie/TV advertisements which could result in them watching more Netflix. This could be improved by removing autoplay while browsing and allow users to just watch the trailer if they would like a taste of the content.
- Cerner Workday Web Interface

    - Purpose of interface:
        - Ensure associates can locate and complete required training modules.
    - Aspect I find bad:
        - Users must know the exact name of the training module they are required to complete in order to find it. 
    - Justification:
        - There is no meaningful way to browse the catalog based on category. The filters available on the left are limited and obscure, meaning you must know the exact name of the training you are required to complete which may be difficult to find. I speculate this is because there have been no defined rules for tagging modules in a way that would make things easier to find. This could be improved by requiring that modules are given an organizational tag, as well as a tag for each project which would require that particular training.
